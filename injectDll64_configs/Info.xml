Notice how it weakens Chrome Browser via Software\Policies\Google\Chrome\CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForUrls

Disables enforcing Certificate Transparency requirements to the listed URLs. This policy allows certificates for the hostnames in the specified URLs to not be disclosed via Certificate Transparency. This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted, because they were not properly publicly disclosed, to continue to be used, but makes it harder to detect misissued certificates for those hosts.
